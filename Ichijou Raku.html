        <p><b>Raku Ichijō</b> (一条 楽, Ichijō Raku) is the main male protagonist of the Nisekoi series that is written and illustrated by Naoshi Komi. He serves as the fake boyfriend of <a target="_blank" href="Kirisaki Chitoge.html">Chitoge Kirisaki</a> for the next three years of his life to prevent a war between the Bee Hive Gang and the Shūei Clan.</p>
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>One summer ten years ago, Raku made a promise to a girl to marry her once they reunite. The promise girl exchanged a pendant with Raku and held on to a key that would unlock it once they meet again. Ten years had passed and Raku has no memory of the girl's name or what she looks like but remembers the promise he made.</p>
        <p>After he started his fake relationship with <a target="_blank" href="Kirisaki Chitoge.html">Chitoge Kirisaki</a> , he encounters a series of events where he learns that <a target="_blank" href="Kirisaki Chitoge.html">Chitoge Kirisaki</a> , <a target="_blank" href="Onodera Kosaki.html">Kosaki Onodera</a>, <a target="_blank" href="Tachibana Marika.html">Marika Tachibana</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="Kanakura Yui.html">Yui Kanakura</a> all possess keys that are connected to his pendant and that they all met each other ten years ago. They all seemed to have made a promise with a boy ten years ago too. This makes all four of the girls be the possible promised girl until Yui returned to Raku and confirmed herself that she is not one of the possible promised girls, despite having a key.</p>
        <p>His interest in the keys that Chitoge, Onodera, Marika, and Yui possess can get him in trouble for certain situations. He will go to great lengths for his pendant and freaks out if he loses it. Chitoge and Raku had tried opening the pendant with her key but it broke in the process. After Raku gets it fixed, Shu's uncle says that the only way to open it is to break it open.</p>
        <p>Raku is also the heir to the Yakuza family as the only son but wishes to not take the position, even if he is urged by the members of the gang.</p>
        <h2>Personality</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Raku Ichijō presents himself to be quite civilized and highly artistic, except when he encounters a person with a lack of respect or regard for him or others around him. As a child, as evidenced in flashbacks, Raku would go as far as to put himself in difficult situations for others' benefits. He is kind and considerate as said by most girls in the and it is also what gets them to fall in love with him. He is easy to get along with and is highly motivated by past actions. He is highly skilled at rough/hard work and is happy to do so, as evidenced in his cooking for his Yakuza clan.</p>
        <p>He can also be highly oblivious of academic faculties and is highly unaware, at times, of certain conversations that he can easily misinterpret, either because of the vagueness of the circumstance, or the fact that he is lost in thought about Chitoge or Onodera. He is dull as he is oblivious to the romantic feelings of the girls around him, especially Chitoge's and Onodera's. He is well-educated and is slow to anger, but will respond with the same emotions or tone, most of the time, if he is addressed as a bean sprout by Chitoge. He can use his faculties to run in order to escape whenever he feels that he is in a situation.</p>

        <h2>Appearance</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Raku is a little taller than average for a high schooler and has messy, black hair. He has lightly tanned, fair skin and also has a big scar on the right side of his forehead.</p>
        <p>In the winter, Raku wears his school's uniform which consists of green and white slip-on shoes, black pants with a green belt, a white long-sleeved shirt, and the school uniform jacket. The summer school uniform's only difference is the white shirt is short-sleeved and the school uniform jacket is not worn. He is generally seen wearing the pendant he was given ten years ago beneath his shirt.</p>
        <p>While swimming, Raku doesn't wear a shirt but wears the school's navy blue swim shorts. He is also seen to wear red shorts in At the Beach.</p>
        <p>Raku generally wears his outfit when he is at home, and casual clothing when he hangs out with the gang or on a date with Chitoge. When he is doing outdoor activities as shown in Temple Festival and Loss, he wears a cloth around his head.</p>

        <h2>Abilities</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Raku Ichijō has demonstrated the following abilities to the best of his capacity:</p>
        <p><ul>
            <p><li><b>Swimming</b>: Ichijō has demonstrated that he is highly capable of swimming at unrealistic capacities. He used these faculties multiple instances, to save Chitoge and to teach Onodera. He also used it to leave the girls' bath and was shown to be capable of holding his breath for a long time.</li></p>
            <p><li><b>Strength/Stamina</b>: Ichijō is shown to be a capable runner, just as anime-like as his swimming faculties, and is able to perform a number of tasks with his strength. He can carry another person, as shown when carrying Seishirō Tsugumi. He is also very agile and flexible with his ability to dodge, despite Tsugumi's ninja-like agility. His flexibility and agility are shown when he repeatedly does handsprings after learning that Kosaki Onodera had been accepted into the same high school as him.</li></p>
            <p><li><b>Endurance</b>: Throughout the series, Raku displays an astounding amount of endurance, able to survive Chitoge's punches albeit still being sent flying with a single punch. Although this was seen more as a comical gag, he did display this endurance on few occasions, e.g. during the climax of Romeo and Juliet play (the same damage incapacitated Claude, who is a professional assassin).</li></p>
            <p><li><b>Acting</b>: He is highly capable of keeping Tsugumi, the Bee Hive gang, and his Yakuza clan from fighting, despite being involved in the somewhat serene circumstances of their "Nisekoi." and during the Romeo and Juliet play in the school festival.</li></p>
            <p><li><b>Altruism</b>: Although not evidenced by Chitoge's rough exterior, he is highly altruistic in a lot his behaviour. He can be thoughtful, despite his lack of thought in certain situations.</li></p>
            <p><li><b>Cooking</b>: He has demonstrated multiple times an almost super-human ability to cook things both quickly and precisely with a little amount of effort.</li></p>
            <p><li><b>Singing</b>: During new year, he is shown to be good at singing that even Chitoge is shocked at how good he is. It is claimed to be one of his specialties but only strictly enka genre.</li></p>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>Weakness</h2>
        <hr>
        <ul><li><b>Animals</b>: For unknown reasons, animals hate Raku and tend to hurt him. However, he himself loves animals very much.</li></ul>

        <ul>
            <p><li>There is a running gag that has Raku earning the ire and jealousy of most of his male classmates because of his involvement with several female characters, only once letting him off in their 2nd-year school trip when Raku is paired up with the other guys instead of the girls.</li></p>
            <p><li>In the original design for Raku in chapter 0, Raku is shown to be very smart, being one of the top students.
